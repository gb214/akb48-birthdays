# akb48-birthdays
Webscrapping the members' names and birthdays of the group akb48 with selenium

Inspired by the birthday paradox, this script uses selenium and python to get data from the
members of the jpop group AKB48 and find which ones share the same birthday.

The code uses chromedriver located in the same directory of the py file.
